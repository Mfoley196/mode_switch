#### Study: Evaluation of Human-Computer Interaction Techniques

_Principal Investigator/Faculty Supervisor:_ Dr. Daniel Vogel, Associate Professor, School of Computer Science, University of Waterloo, 519-888-4567 ext. 33561, [dvogel@uwaterloo.ca](mailto:dvogel@uwaterloo.ca)

_Students and Co-Investigators:_ 

Margaret Foley &lt;mjfoley@uwaterloo.ca> \
Quentin Roy &lt;quentin.roy@uwaterloo.ca>

To help you make an informed decision regarding your participation, this letter will explain what the study is about, the possible risks and benefits, and your rights as a research participant.  If you do not understand something in the letter, please ask one of the investigators prior to consenting to the study. You will be provided with a copy of the information and consent form if you choose to participate in the study.


#### What is the study about?

You are invited to participate in a research study examining methods for people to interact with computers and other digital devices. In this experiment, you will complete simple tasks to test how you choose to use a graphical user interface. This is important because understanding the characteristics and performance of human-computer interaction can discover new interaction methods and improve existing interaction methods. The results of this study contribute to graduate theses and faculty research.


### 1. Your responsibilities as a participant


#### What does participation involve?

Participation in the study will consist of a 60 minute session scheduled at the location of your choice. During a session, you will be asked to type text or manipulate graphical widgets to complete simple tasks such as answering general questions, selecting objects in an image, or moving graphical objects. The questions or images are not personal or controversial in nature.

During the experiment, you may also be asked for your opinion of the techniques and tasks regarding factors such as overall preference, fatigue, comfort, speed, accuracy, utility, suitability, etc. A researcher may observe and take notes regarding your interactions, and may ask you verbal questions about what you are experiencing when completing the experiment.  You may decline to respond to questions if you wish. If you wish to decline a written question, leave it blank.

Your computer interactions will also be captured and stored in a computer log file.  With your permission, you may also be audio recorded and/or videotaped; however, for publications, public datasets, or presentations, your identity will be masked by altering tone and pitch in the audio and obscuring identity in the video by blurring.


#### Who may participate in the study?

In order to participate in the study: you must be able to enter text on a computer and control a computer cursor using a mouse, touchpad, or similar pointing device.


### 2. Your rights as a participant


#### What are the possible benefits of the study?

Participation in this study may not provide any personal benefit to you. The study will benefit the academic community and society in general by contributing a better understanding of human-computer interaction and potentially inventing new methods of interaction.


#### Will I receive remuneration for participating in the study?

In appreciation of your time, you will receive $10_._ If you begin a session but do not complete it, your participation in the study will end and you will be remunerated for the proportion of what you completed, up to half the full session remuneration. The remuneration you receive is taxable: it is your responsibility to report this amount for income tax purposes. 


#### What are the risks associated with the study?

There is potential for minor discomfort or fatigue from performing repeated tasks, but the physical requirements of the task are like normal computer usage and/or common real-world tasks. We will minimize this risk by requiring and/or encouraging rest breaks.

During the experiment you may touch or wear a device (e.g. goggles, gloves, smartphone, touchscreen), so there is potential for transmission of bacteria. We will minimize this risk by cleaning the device after each participant session using a disinfectant spray, rubbing alcohol, or similar cleanser.


#### Is participation in the study voluntary?

Your participation in this study is voluntary. You may decide to withdraw from the study at any time by communicating this to the researcher.


#### Will my identity be known?

The research team will know which data is from your participation, but all data will be anonymized for analysis, reporting, and public data sharing.


#### Will my information be kept confidential?

The association between your identify and the research data is considered completely confidential.  Your name will not appear in any public dataset or publication resulting from this study.  In all cases, participants will only be referred to using generic labels (P1, P2, …) or collectively as a group (Group A, Group B,…).  

Consent forms with participant names collected during this study will be retained on encrypted removable media if electronic and/or in locked cabinets if paper.  

You will be explicitly asked for consent for the use of any photo/video/audio data for the purpose of reporting the study’s findings.  If consent is granted, these data will be used only for the purposes associated with teaching, scientific presentations, publications, and/or sharing with other researchers. You will not be identified by name, and where possible, the images will be anonymized.

All identifiable information will be deleted from the dataset collected so that individual participant's anonymity will be protected. The de-identified data will be accessible by the study investigators as well as the broader scientific community. More specifically, the data may be posted on public databases and/or made available to other researchers upon publication, so that data may be inspected and analyzed by other researchers. The data that will be shared will not contain any information that can identify you.


### 3. Questions, comments, or concerns


#### Who is sponsoring/funding this study?

This study is funded/sponsored by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), the Province of Ontario, and the University of Waterloo.


#### Has the study received ethics clearance?

This study has been reviewed and received ethics clearance through a University of Waterloo Research Ethics Committee (ORE# 31173). If you have questions for the Committee contact the Office of Research Ethics at 1-519-888-4567 ext. 36005 or [ore-ceo@uwaterloo.ca](mailto:ore-ceo@uwaterloo.ca).


#### Who should I contact if I have questions regarding my participation in the study?

If you have any questions regarding this study, or would like additional information to assist you in reaching a decision about participation, please contact Dr. Daniel Vogel at 516.888.4567 x33561 or by email at [dvogel@uwaterloo.ca](mailto:dvogel@uwaterloo.ca).
